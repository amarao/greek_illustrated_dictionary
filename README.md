# Greek dictionary, illustrated

This is my humble attempt to create an illustrated dictionary for Greek language.
I heavily use Dall-E (and may be, some other NN), but for the goal of having
pictures in the dictionary it's more than worth it.

Current (incomplete) results [are here](illustrated_greek_dictionary.md).

I'm still wondering about structure for the project, insofar I made greek word
the key (with article at the end, like 'βιβλίο, το', images and translations
in different languages. If you want to contribute, you are more than welcome.

Please, pay attention, that all human-commited text is CC0 (public domain),
and AI output is assumed to be non-copyrightable.

If you contribute images, please be very careful to review them. For
simple nouns ('table', 'chair') the subject should dominate the image without
AI-specific artifacts, and no other objects should be visible.

For verbs, adverbs and complicated nouns (like 'combination') you may opt for
small stips of images describing idea. Try to be multicultural and not
limit concept to some culture-specific idea (like independence with 'independence
day').
